This is a high yield farming bot that has a very unique function of a stoploss. The moment it detects volatility it pulls out of the yield and sells into a stablecoin , then it waits for the volatility to subside sells the stable coin and goes back to yield farming. This feature makes this bot make tremendous amount of money during volatility. During extreme volatility I've seen this bot double it's holdings in less than one day. The best thing this is 100% open source written in JavaScript and ran straight in any web browser. 

Here's my 29 day test results
